function Set-RestrictedExecutionPolicy {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Sets the machine-wide (LocalMachine) execution policy to Restricted.
    .DESCRIPTION
        LocalMachine scope persists after this session ends. A session started with
        -ExecutionPolicy Bypass keeps running under its Process-scope override, so the
        module can finish; new sessions get Restricted. Group Policy or a CurrentUser
        policy still take precedence over LocalMachine and are reported as warnings.
