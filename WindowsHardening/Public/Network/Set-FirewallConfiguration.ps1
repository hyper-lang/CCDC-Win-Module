.SYNOPSIS
    Configures Windows Firewall with mandatory Deny All Inbound rule and optional port allowances.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function consolidates all firewall configuration logic. It always creates a high-priority
    "Deny All Inbound" rule for security. It then handles three scenarios:

    - -FirewallPorts given: allows exactly those ports (no prompts).
    - -NonInteractive without ports: Deny All only for Local; common AD/DC ports for AD.
    - Neither: prompts for ports and confirmation.

    -AdditionalPorts are added on top of whichever set was chosen.

    -Prompt picks the base set the same way -NonInteractive does (-FirewallPorts, else the
    AD ports on a DC), then asks for extra ports to allow on top of it.

    Existing "Allow <Protocol> <Port>" rules from earlier runs are re-enabled instead of
    duplicated, and enabled Block rules that would override an Allow rule are reported.
    To open a port later without resetting the firewall, use Add-FirewallPort.

    Domain-vs-Local branching is driven by $script:HardeningContext.OS.IsDomainController.

.PARAMETER FirewallPorts
    Ports to allow. When given, no prompts are shown and no ports are added automatically.

.PARAMETER AdditionalPorts
    Extra ports to allow on top of -FirewallPorts, the DC defaults, or the ports chosen at
    the prompt - e.g. a database or web port the box is known to need.

.PARAMETER NonInteractive
    Never prompt (used by Invoke-WindowsHardening), unless -Prompt is also given.

.PARAMETER Prompt
    Keep the default ports (or -FirewallPorts), then ask which extra ports to allow. The
    suggested scored/AD ports not already allowed are listed; unlisted ports can be typed;
    Enter adds none.

.PARAMETER PreserveManagementPort
    When set, creates Allow rules for TCP 5986 (WinRM-HTTPS) and TCP 5985
    (WinRM-HTTP) after all existing rules are disabled, so a remote session
    applying this over WinRM does not lock itself out. The later port-rule loop
    skips both to avoid duplicates.
